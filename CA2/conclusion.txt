Previous work:
1. build up the sequence model for jobshop scheduling
2. evaluate and optimize the scheduling system(blocking rate--back-up machines)
3. find the dataset(machine failure conditions) from UCI respository to build up the machine failure model using XGBoost method
4. introduce the machine failure model into the scheduling system
5. introduce digital twin machine learning -assisted simulation model to realize the optimization of the whole system

digital twin machine learning -assisted simulation model:
1. preprocessing
2. load data and fit the polynomial formula --> create the physical model
3. compare the experimental data with physical model --> virtual model
4. design a hybrid digital twin to arrive at better predictions
	-->build a recurrent neural network model that can compensate for the simulation errors
5. compile the hybird digital twin:	
    physics-based simulation model (still not being optimal)
    data-driven machine learning model (compensating for the model errors)
6. make a prediction and fitting.
