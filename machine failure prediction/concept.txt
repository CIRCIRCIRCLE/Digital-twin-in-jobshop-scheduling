1.general idea---the probability of machine breakdowns
• use ML techniques to predict the probability of machine breakdowns 

• • through the real-time data captured from the sensors, and consider a
Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) process to optimize the JSS 
by reducing unexpected machine failures during operation.

2. dataset  --- UCI Machine Learning Repository
• The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset is a synthetic dataset 
that reflects real predictive maintenance data encountered in industry.
• • The data is collected from sensors including air temperature(k), process temperature (k), 
rotational speed (rpm), torque (Nm), tool wear(min), and indicated the machine status (normal or
failure) in 10,000 records.

• • we search through some online open data sources providing real datasets
such as GitHub, NASA, DataWorld, and Kaggle. Finally, we find this proper dataset
related to maintenance logs of a machine working in a manufacturing system
and consider it as a maintenance log of our processing machines. 

3.data analyzing and visualization
• different reasons for break-down
• • If we assume that the data is captured every 30 minutes, it means that the 10,000 records of
data are collected in 5,000 working hours of the stamping machine. Of the 10,000 records,
the machine experienced 339 times of failures which is 3.39% of the total records.
• • For the single cause of machine damage, HDF is the most influential, so we first divide the data according to HDF

• pair plot: correlations between variables
• • we use the pair plot diagram for data visualization to see correlations between
variables by categorizing data into red points (when HDF=0) and blue points (when HDF=1)
(see figure 27).

3. prediction model--
• Defining dataset and variables
• Splitting the HDF dataset into a training set and test set
• Training decision tree and random forest ML techniques on the HDF dataset
• Test the results of the ML techniques on the test set
